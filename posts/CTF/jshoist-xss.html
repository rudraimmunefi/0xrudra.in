    <h1>XSS Challenge by Johan</h1>
    <div class="meta">Published on 15th December 2023 by 0xrudra</div>
    <div class="content">
     <p>I recently engaged with an XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) challenge created by Johan Carlsson, which you can find on his Twitter page <a href="https://twitter.com/joaxcar/status/1732397874502078585">here</a>.<br> <br>Despite numerous attempts and some procrastination, which included skimming over JavaScript hoisting concepts, I found myself unable to crack the challenge. <br> <br>However, this process taught me an important lesson about the need to slow down and focus, as I often rush through code and articles.

Previously, I had missed Johan's first challenge but later came across his write-up on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/joaxcar/status/1731766035513008238">here</a>. <br><br>This introduced me to the concept of JavaScript hoisting, a term I was unfamiliar with and initially found baffling, especially in understanding how it influenced the challenge's payload. Driven by curiosity, I quickly Googled the concept and superficially convinced myself that I had grasped it. Armed with this new, albeit surface-level knowledge, I attempted Johan's second XSS challenge and, unfortunately, did not succeed. <br><br>

This experience serves as a reminder and an effort on my part to solidify my understanding of the basics of JavaScript hoisting and its practical applications.

In a javascript the variables and function declaration are reassigned to the top of the scope before the code execution. This is called <b>hoisting</b>.
<br><br>
Let's understand better with an example.
<br>
<pre>
<code><b>a = 5; 
var a;</b></code>
</pre>
What do you think is suppose to happen after executing this piece of code since we haven't declared a in the start of the code? <br><br>

The answer to this is that the code will not throw errors since the variable declaration was automatically reassigned to the top and assigning value 5 to a and this is known as javascript hoisting.  <br> <br>

<h4><b>Note:</b> Only the declaration get's hoisted and not the initialization.</h4> <br>
Hoisting works well with variables declared with var but will throw error if the variable was declared using let or const keyword.<br><br>
<pre>
<code><b>a = 5; 
let a;</b></code>
</pre><br>
<i>Throws error `Uncaught <b>ReferenceError</b>: Cannot access 'a' before initialization`</i><br><br>

Accessing a <i>`let`</i> declared variable before the declaration should result in `ReferenceError`.<br><br>

Armed with the knowledge we shall solve the challenge right? Well, I'm noob so a big <b>NO</b>. <br><br>

But let's try to understand what the code expect from us and let's see from there.

Code is pretty straightforward (for me):<br>
<pre>
<code>
(function(){
  config = {
    env: "prod"
  }  
  try {
    if(config){
      return;
    }
    // TODO handle missing config for: https://try-to-catch.glitch.me/"
  } catch {
    fetch("/error", {
      method: "POST",
      body: {
        url:"https://try-to-catch.glitch.me/"
      }
    })
  }
})()
</code>
</pre>
<br>
We know that if we want to execute the sweet little popup we would need to enter the `catch` block but since the try block would return in the if condition no matter what you enter in the catch block it would not be executed.
<br><br>
So the idea is to use `let` variable hoisiting to create a variable named `config` such that if the code is rearranged and executed it will throw `ReferenceError` and we will enter the `catch` block.
<br><br>
POC taken from Jonah's blog - <a href="https://try-to-catch.glitch.me/%22-alert()-%22%E2%80%A8let%20config">https://try-to-catch.glitch.me/%22-alert()-%22%E2%80%A8let%20config</a>
<br><br>
It's very creative approach to solving the challenge it uses a unicode new line character to balance the try and catch block syntax and execute XSS.
<br><br>

With that I conclude my knowledge of hoisting, see you later.
